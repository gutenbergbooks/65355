<p class="drop-cap">AMONG the Indians who used to
roam over our Western prairies in
such vast numbers, story telling
was of the greatest importance.
From the opening of spring,
through the summer, and far into
the fall, the men and older boys
of the tribe were out each day hunting the deer
in the hills and the buffalo on the plains or
spearing fish in the streams. The women and
girls meantime were occupied with their household
duties about the tepees.</p>

<p>But at last came the long winter months
when game was scarce, and the old trails
were covered with a blanket of snow. Then
the Indians would retreat to the snug wigwams,
and there await the coming of spring
again. They had no books to read or newspapers
and magazines with which to while
away those long winter days, and life would
have been dull indeed had it not been for
their ability to tell stories to each other.</p>

<p>They never lacked material out of which
to build those tales. Each bird and beast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
each herb and flower; in fact, every living
thing that ran, or crawled, or flew about their
native forests was known to the Indians.
They studied the habits of the wild creatures
to an extent that we might well follow.</p>

<p>Then there were other forces that entered
into their lives and stories. In the flash of
lightning from a dark cloud, in the roll of
thunder, in the rush of wind, or in the roar
of waters tumbling over a cliff into the river
below, they heard the voice of the Great
Spirit, unseen but powerful.</p>

<p>And so all their legends were woven
around these things and were full of strange
incidents that had happened to them on their
hunting trips. Many included adventures
that had been related by their fathers and
grandfathers around the winter camp fires
years and years before.</p>

<p>Let us imagine that we, too, are curled up
comfortably on a deer-skin in a chief&#8217;s tepee,
close beside the glowing campfire, whose
flames cast a ruddy light on the circle of
dark faces all about it, especially on that of
the chief who, pipe in hand, is just about to
relate some of these old legends of the American
Indians.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Lost Giant</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ONCE upon a time, far back in the
days when the elk, the moose, and
the buffalo roamed over the hills and
plains of North America, and little Indian children
could call all the animals by name,
there lived among one of the northern
tribes a very unhappy little boy named
Wasewahto.</p>

<p>His mother had been a chieftain&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
daughter, but she had died when the
boy was a mere baby. His father had
taken another wife, Wapiti&mdash;&#8220;the elk&#8221;&mdash;so
called by reason of her large ugly
head. Wasewahto&#8217;s father was dead now,
too, and the little boy lived alone with
his stepmother, who had no love for
him and treated him very badly. He
was too small to hunt and fish for his
own food, and often Wapiti refused to
share hers with him, giving him only a
few bones to gnaw.</p>

<p>One day she rolled up her belongings
into a bundle and, without a word
to Wasewahto, went away. Two days
passed without a sign of her return.
Then the little boy, hungry and frightened,
sat down before his tent and cried
bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image013.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE SWUNG THE CHILD ALOFT ON HIS SHOULDER</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>As he sat there sobbing and crying he
felt the earth quiver beneath him, and
looking up, he saw through his tears,
a giant Indian who towered up to the
very tree tops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you crying?&#8221; asked the giant
in a voice like distant thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am all alone,&#8221; answered
Wasewahto. &#8220;My stepmother has been
gone two days and I have no food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the stepson of Wapiti?&#8221;
asked the giant. The little boy nodded,
and the giant continued: &#8220;Then she will
never come back&mdash;she has gone to another
tribe. Come home with me.&#8221; And
he swung the child aloft on his big
broad shoulder. Away they went to the
giant&#8217;s wigwam, and there Wasewahto
lived happily for many moons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>But one night the giant had a dream,
in which the spirit of Wasewahto&#8217;s
father appeared to him, and told him to
return the boy to his stepmother. The
dream was so vivid that it troubled
him, and he began to break camp the
next morning, and prepare for a march.</p>

<p>But when Wasewahto heard what his
friend proposed to do, he cried and
cried, and clung to the giant, and
begged him not to go, but the big man
was still worried over his dream, and insisted
upon going.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will not leave you unless I
find a tribe which will be kind to you,&#8221;
he said at last, as they were starting,
and with that promise Wasewahto had
to be satisfied. The giant swung the
boy to his shoulder and set out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>After four days&#8217; travel they reached
a strange camp, and here they found
Wapiti. She was furiously angry when
she saw the boy, but a fear of the
giant kept her silent. When he had
told her his dream, she too felt uneasy,
and pretended to welcome Wasewahto.
But when the giant left him with his
stepmother, and prepared to leave, the
child sobbed and cried so hard and pleaded
so earnestly with his friend to stay and
live near him, that the big man paused.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing016.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">IN ANOTHER INSTANT THEY CAME FLYING OUT OF THE BAG</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stay if the tribe will have
me,&#8221; he said at last, and no one dared
refuse. When they had given their consent
the giant said: &#8220;I will work for
the tribe&mdash;I will hunt and fish and
fight&mdash;but one thing you must promise
me. Never give me otter&#8217;s flesh to eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
or I will go away and never return.&#8221;</p>




<p>So the tribe promised, and little
Wasewahto was happy. The giant taught
him to hunt and fish, so that never
again would he have to starve if Wapiti
should desert him. The little boy soon
had many friends. He was so merry
and bright, his aim with an arrow was
so true and he was such a brave little
warrior, that all the tribe loved him.</p>

<p>All but Wapiti&mdash;she still hated the
boy, and she hated the giant even more,
for she felt that had it not been for
him, she would long ago have been rid
of the unwelcome child. In her heart
she was always trying to make some
plan whereby she might be freed from
both of them. One day a hunter brought
in a freshly killed deer for the giant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
who was very fond of roast venison,
and Wapiti at last had her chance.</p>

<p>She prepared a splendid roast, but
here and there among the deer meat
she made a tiny slit with a sharp knife,
and slid in pieces of otter flesh. The
giant returned from fishing, with a ravenous
appetite, and sat down to the meal with
a relish. But the first bite revealed the
trickery of Wapiti, and with a furious
glare at her, the giant leaped to his
feet, strode from the camp, and never
was seen again by the tribe.</p>

<p>Soon the warriors returned, and when
they learned what had happened, Wapiti
had no further chance to carry out her
cruel plans against Wasewahto, for they
drove her from the camp with stones
and arrows, and said if ever she returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
her life would be forfeited.
Then they adopted her stepson as the
child of the tribe.</p>

<p>Poor little Wasewahto! Though he was
among friends, he grieved continually for
the loss of his dear giant, as did all
the tribe, though not as bitterly. He
could not be tempted with even the
daintiest foods, and he did not care to
play any more. The Indians made him
splendid bows and arrows, and the medicine-man
carved a rattle for him out
of a buffalo bone, but nothing seemed
to make him happy. As winter came
on he grew thinner and paler and sadder
every day, and shivered at the
slightest breeze.</p>

<p>At last his friends could bear it no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
longer, and begged him to tell them
what, next to having the giant back
again, would make him happiest.</p>

<p>He answered at once, &#8220;Take me where
the summer is. If I could see flowers
in the woods, and could shoot at the
birds with my bow and arrows again, I
believe I could be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we will hunt for the summer-land,
oh little Wasewahto,&#8221; they cried,
and set out the next day at sunrise.</p>

<p>For many days they traveled toward
the south, and at last, on the shores
of a great lake, they came upon a
strange tepee. It was that of a hostile
tribe, however, and so Wasewahto&#8217;s friends
hid themselves in the rushes by the
water&#8217;s edge, and called on the beaver
to help them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;What you seek is indeed here,&#8221; said
the wise old animal, when they had
told him their story, &#8220;And I will help
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly he asked the moose to
swim to the middle of the lake, and in
the meantime he began gnawing busily
at the canoe paddles of the hostile
tribe, not enough to saw them off entirely,
but merely to weaken them.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shout from the
tepee. Someone had seen the moose and
all were eager to chase him. The
enemies of Wasewahto and his friends
ran to the shore, leaped into their
canoes, and put out after the moose.</p>

<p>When they were well out into the
middle of the lake the beaver led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Wasewahto and his friends into the
tepee by a hidden tent flap, so that
they might not be seen from the water
side. From the very top of the highest
tent pole there hung a great leather
bag. As soon as he saw it, Wasewahto
began to smile, a little at first, then
more and more, and at last, laughing
aloud, he caught up his little bow and
arrows and aimed straight at the hanging
pouch.</p>

<p>As the dart pierced the leather, the wigwam
was suddenly filled with the twittering
of birds, and in another instant
they came flying out of the bag and
out of the tepee&mdash;thousands of them,
robins, woodpeckers, swallows, orioles,
jays, wrens, bluebirds, and many others.
For summer had been tied up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
leather pouch, there to hang quietly
until another year.</p>

<p>The Indians on the lake had by this
time discovered that there were intruders
in their camp, and that summer, placed
in their keeping, had been set free.
Desperately they began to head for
shore, but now under the strain all the
paddles broke, and the Indians were
left floating on the lake, screaming with
helpless rage, while the moose swam
away to cover.</p>

<p>Now it began to be summer everywhere.
The snow and ice melted away;
the brook, which had been locked up
under layers of ice, began to gurgle
and laugh again; the green leaves came
out on the trees, and even the flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
began to spring up in the woods. Wasewahto
was perfectly happy. He grew
plump and rosy, and he laughed with
joy as he shot his arrows and threw
the harpoon for fish.</p>

<p>But the beaver and the moose came
presently to think that perhaps they
had meddled with things that were not
their affair, and that if the Great Spirit
had intended it to be summer all the
time, he would not have tied it up in
a bag part of the year. So they decided
to correct their mistake; but when
at last they had fixed upon a plan,
they found they could not agree upon
the length of time summer should be
allowed out of its prison. So they
called all the animals together and asked
for their advice. Everyone had a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
idea. Some advised a month,
some ten, some eleven.</p>

<p>At last up jumped an old frog, and
holding out his webbed foot, with its
four toes, so that all might see it, he
croaked in his deep voice, &#8220;Have four&mdash;have
four&mdash;have four&mdash;&#8221; over and over
again, until he drowned out the voices
of the others. His persistence so wearied
them that at last they gave in to him
and decided on four, as he wished.</p>

<p>So now there are but four months
of summer in the Northland, and little
Wasewahto is perfectly happy during
those days. Then he smiles all the
time, as he works and plays. That is
why the sunshine is so pleasant, and
why the brooks seem to gurgle with
joy in the summer time. But when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
winter days come, and the cold rains
of autumn fall, those are the tears of
Wasewahto, sitting by the fire and weeping
for his lost friend, the giant.</p>

<p class="ph2">The Feathered Bridegroom</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LONG, long ago, before the coming of
the white man to the shores of
America, there lived, far up in the
north country, near the banks of a
broad river, a squaw named Speckled
Eagle, with her little son Running Buffalo
and her beautiful daughter Deerfoot,
a maiden of fifteen.</p>

<p>Speckled Eagle was the widow of a
great warrior and she determined that
her daughter should never marry until
there came to woo her some mighty
chieftain of a powerful tribe. Many a
young brave came to the tepee, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Deerfoot was as good as she was lovely.
Many a one would have wed her,
but none were ever rich or noble
enough to please Speckled Eagle.</p>

<p>But one day as the family sat before
its tent, weaving mats of sweet grass,
a white canoe came gliding down the
broad river, and in it there sat a handsome
stranger. He was clad all in white,
in garments made of deer-skin, sewed
over with beads and shells and trimmed
with ermine tails.</p>

<p>Speckled Eagle looked at him eagerly.
Ah, if only he were coming to woo
Deerfoot! As she watched, the stranger
gave a few skillful strokes of his paddle
that sent his canoe out of the current
and brought it gliding toward the shore
before Speckled Eagle&#8217;s lodge. In another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
moment he was stepping out upon
the pebbly shore.</p>

<p>All a-flutter with excitement Speckled
Eagle went hurrying down to meet him,
not forgetting in her haste to snatch up
a bundle of bark which hung in the
tepee. When she had greeted the strange
brave and bade him welcome to her
lodge, she spread pieces of the bark
before him on the ground from the
landing to the tepee, to do him honor.
When he had reached the campfire, she
begged him to rest on a soft pile of
skins while she and her daughter prepared
a feast for him.</p>

<p>Everyone in her camp was delighted
with the handsome stranger&mdash;all but one
old dog which growled and showed his
teeth from the moment the unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
brave stepped ashore. The man trembled
at the dog&#8217;s angry snarls, and said he
could not eat a bit of the feast until
that ugly animal was taken away.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing033.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">DEERFOOT GREETS THE STRANGER</p>

<p>Anxious to please her noble guest,
Speckled Eagle led the old dog out into
the bushes and killed him, though she
dared not tell Deerfoot what she had
done, for the girl was fond of the
faithful dog.</p>

<p>Soon the stranger made it known that
he was a chieftain from the far north,
who had made a temporary camp down
the river a few miles below Speckled
Eagle&#8217;s tepee. Furthermore he said that
he wished to wed the lovely Deerfoot.
The girl was so charmed by his handsome
face, his well-built figure and
splendid carriage that she consented at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
once. Speckled Eagle was more than
satisfied to have so fine a son-in-law.
So a great wedding feast was held and
Deerfoot married the strange brave that
night.</p>




<p>On the following morning when
Speckled Eagle was ready to make a
fire, she went out into the bushes to
get some dry faggots. There lay the
body of the old dog she had killed,
pecked full of holes as if a great bird
had feasted on it. The soft earth
round about was marked by strange
three-toed prints.</p>

<p>A sudden fear came to Speckled Eagle&#8217;s
heart. She hurried back to the camp,
and asked all present to take off their
moccasins or shoes. All did as she bade&mdash;all
but the stranger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;I never take off my shoes,&#8221; he said
haughtily, &#8220;It is a custom of my
tribe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But see the beautiful moccasins I have
made for you,&#8221; insisted Speckled Eagle.
For many moons she had worked on them,
intending them to be a wedding gift
for her noble son-in-law, whenever he
should appear. They were of the softest
leather, heavily beaded and worked in
quills of the porcupine, and the stranger&#8217;s
eyes began to glisten as he looked
at them. Like a flash he whipped off
his own moccasins, and put on the new
ones before Speckled Eagle could see his
feet. But the little brother&#8217;s eyes were
sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he cried in terror, &#8220;he has
feet like a bird&mdash;he has only three toes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>At this the stranger grew angry and
looked at the little boy so fiercely that
he said no more, but Speckled Eagle
was strangely troubled and felt that all
was not right.</p>

<p>When they had breakfasted the stranger
ordered his bride to follow him to his
camp, far down the river, where he had
many beautiful gifts for her. Deerfoot
did not want to go. The incident of
the moccasins had frightened her, but
her husband promised her they should
return by sundown, so at last she
climbed into the stern of his canoe,
while the stranger took his place at the
bow, and they paddled away down
stream.</p>

<p>Deerfoot looked back at the camp as
long as she could see it, and watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Speckled Eagle and the little brother,
Running Buffalo, waving to her from
the shore. But at last a turn of the
river hid them from view.</p>

<p>For several hours Deerfoot and her husband
went on down the river with the
current, he paddling, she giving an occasional
stroke, where the stream did
not run as fast as usual. About noon-day
it began to rain, a shower at first, then
a downpour. As the rain continued to
fall harder and harder, the bride suddenly
noticed that the water was washing
away her husband&#8217;s splendid white
coat, and beneath it she could see
black feathers and a long black tail.</p>

<p>Then she knew what evil had befallen
her. She had married a Crow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the bird of wickedness, whose tricky
ways oft deceived the Indians.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was very much frightened, but
she began to plan her escape at once.
With her small deft hands she tied the
long black tail to the crossbar of the
canoe, using a leather thong from her
moccasins.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; asked the Crow,
as he felt her fingers among his feathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoothing down your beautiful coat,
and sewing on some of the beads that
have become loosened,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see you are industrious, as a
good wife should be,&#8221; he answered with
a sly grin, but without turning.</p>

<p>All the long afternoon they floated
down the river, and as it drew on
toward sunset the canoe glided along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
into a rushy, reed-covered marsh where
the wild ducks made their nests. As
the canoe slipped among the grasses,
dozens of frightened birds rose in great
flocks and flew across the marshes.</p>

<p>&#8220;These shores are full of duck eggs,
husband,&#8221; said Deerfoot, as she watched
the circling birds. Seized by a sudden
idea she cried: &#8220;Let me land here for
a moment, and I will soon find a dozen
for your supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the Crow was hungry, and the
prospect of a dozen roasted duck eggs
pleased him immensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good wife,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but make haste&mdash;we still have far to
go,&#8221; and he ran the canoe close to the
shore.</p>

<p>Before the keel had even grated on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the pebbles, like the swift-footed deer for
whom she was named, the Indian maid had
sprung ashore and darted up the bank
into the forest. She was soon out of
sight speeding like an arrow through
the woods, back to her mother, her brother,
and her home.</p>

<p>The Crow gave a harsh cry, which resembled
a caw, as he saw her go, and
began screaming at the top of his voice:
&#8220;Stop&mdash;stop&mdash;I&#8217;ll bring you back, and
punish you for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he could not free himself to follow
her. Deerfoot had fastened his tail too
securely to the crossbar for him to
loosen it easily. It took him nearly an
hour to untie the last knot, for it was
no easy task to reach around behind
his back, and, by the sense of touch alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
pick out countless knots tied in wet
leather.</p>

<p>By the time the Crow had untied all
the thongs that held him. Deerfoot was
far away in the forest, so he sunk his
canoe, resumed his bird shape once more
and flew off screeching as he went:
&#8220;Again I have tricked my enemy&mdash;man.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph2">Mandowmin of the Maize</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">IN the history of the Pilgrims and
their early struggles on the bleak
shores of New England, it is told how
they were taught by the friendly Indians,
Samoset and Squanto, to plant
Indian corn, which soon became one of
the principal articles of food on their
tables. And even now, after nearly
three hundred years, there is scarcely
any food we think of as more truly
American, than corn meal mush, or piping
hot corn cakes.</p>

<p>But long long ago, before the feet of
white men ever trod the forest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
New World, as America was called in
those days, and while Indians in vast
numbers roamed over the land, there
was a time when Indian corn or maize
was unknown even to the red men.
Their food consisted almost entirely of
meat&mdash;the fleet-footed deer and wild
turkey&mdash;and fish from the little trout
streams. Sometimes a handful of sweet
berries was found, which added zest to
the meal.</p>

<p>Life ran on smoothly in the summer
time, for then the Indians lived
well, but when the long, snowy New
England winters set in, it was quite a
different matter. The streams froze over,
the birds flew south, and the deer retreated
farther into the depths of the
forest. Sometimes when there had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
an unusually large number of deer
killed in the fall, the Indian women
cut up the flesh into strips and dried
it in the warm bright autumn sunshine.
This dried meat was then stored away
for the long winter. But the supply
seldom lasted until spring, and the people
had to face days of famine and
suffering during which many of them
died.</p>

<p>Now it chanced in those days that there
lived a little Indian boy named Waso.
He was the son of a chieftain, and like
his father he had a kind and gentle
heart. The chieftain never forgot to
give thanks to the Great Spirit for
every catch of fish and for every nimble
deer his sharp arrows killed. When
times of famine fell upon the tribe, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
shared with them until he had no more
left to give, and he was constantly trying
to discover ways in which he might
help his people.</p>

<p>Little Waso, growing from babyhood into
boyhood in this kindly atmosphere, began to
think very seriously of the welfare of his
tribe, over whom he would some day
rule as a chieftain.</p>

<p>Often he dreamed strange dreams. He
would imagine that he was walking
through a dense forest where the briars
and brambles stung him, and brought
out a rash on his tender skin. But
then, at his very feet would spring up
a cluster of bright berries, or some
green herb, and a voice seemed to urge
him to crush the plant and lay it on
the red spot. He obeyed and was instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
healed. So too, in a dream,
was the bite of a poisonous snake
cured. The strangest part of all was
that on the following day these things
all happened exactly as in his vision.
Waso always found the herb he needed
growing near him, and thus was saved
from many a misfortune.</p>

<p>He told his father of these things, and
the chieftain called together the older
men of the tribe and related to them
all that had happened. They believed
his dreams were messages from the
Great Spirit, and from that time each
particular herb of which the child had
dreamed, was carefully gathered and
stored away for use as medicine. All
the old men declared that Waso would
some day become a great chieftain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>At last, for little Waso, came the
time when an Indian boy goes away
from his family and fasts and calls on
the Great Spirit to show him a vision
of his future life and teach him how
to live wisely and well. So the chieftain
built a little wigwam for Waso, at
some distance from the others, and the
boy went to it, and began the solemn
rites.</p>

<p>That first night in his tent alone, he
dreamed that the Great Spirit sent a
new gift to his people, a food by means of
which it would be easier for them to live
and which would provide against days
of famine. This gift was called Mandowmin
and was to grow out of the
black soil. But the manner in which
he should find it was not revealed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Waso and after he awoke he could
think of nothing else but the mysterious
gift.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing048.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE NEXT DAY THE YOUNG BRAVE APPEARED</p>

<p>He fasted for three days in his
lonely tent, sleeping at night on a bed
of skins. The third day, weak from
lack of food, he looked out of his
doorway at sunset, and saw a splendid
young brave flying down from the sky.
He was clad all in green and yellow,
and a tuft of green plumes nodded on
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am come, oh Little-Chieftain-Who-Loves-His-People,
from the Great Spirit,&#8221;
said the stranger. &#8220;He looks with favor
upon you and your father the Chieftain,
because you contend not with arrows
and spears, but seek only the good of
your people. I have great news for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
you, news of a wonderful gift from the
Great Spirit; but first you must wrestle
with me, as it is only by overcoming
me that you may learn the secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Waso was so faint and weak
that he swayed as he stood, but without
hesitation he began to wrestle with
the mysterious stranger. It was an unequal
struggle, however, and soon the
boy lay on his back, panting for
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come again tomorrow,&#8221; said
the stranger, and vanished.</p>

<p>The next day at the same hour the
young brave appeared at Waso&#8217;s tent,
and again they wrestled. Once more
Waso was vanquished, but the stranger
only smiled his kind friendly smile and
said: &#8220;Be brave, little Waso! You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
another chance&mdash;tomorrow&mdash;but your last&mdash;remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the third day Waso was so weak
that he could scarcely stand, but he said
to himself that he must win in order
to learn the great secret for his people.
And so much did his strong will help
his weak body that at last he overthrew
the young brave in green.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done, Little Chieftain,&#8221; said the
stranger, as he arose from the ground,
where Waso had thrown him in the
struggle, and dusted off his garments.
&#8220;Tomorrow at set of sun I will come
again for the last time. If I am vanquished
I shall die. You must then
strip off my garments, clear a spot of
earth free from all stones, weeds and
roots, soften the earth, and bury me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
that spot. Then come often to my
grave, and see if perchance I have returned
to life once more; but let no
weeds grow over me. Promise that you
will do all as I tell you, and then you
shall know the secret of the Great
Spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waso promised though with tears in
his eyes. He had grown to love the
handsome stranger with whom he had
wrestled on three days at sunset, and
the thought of his death saddened the
boy, but he gave him his word.</p>

<p>The next morning the chieftain came
to his son&#8217;s tent with food.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have proved yourself a man,
my son,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A longer fast may
do you harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Waso answered: &#8220;Wait only, oh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
my father, until evening, and when the
sun goes down I shall return to your
fireside.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the chieftain went home alone.</p>

<p>At sunset the strange brave returned
and appeared once more at Waso&#8217;s
tent. For the last time they fought.
Steadily Waso gained and finally the
stranger sank weakly to his knees. He
arose again, and once more Waso put
forth all his strength and threw his foe
to earth. The stranger murmured faintly:
&#8220;Your promise&mdash;remember,&#8221; and spoke
no more.</p>

<p>Gently, tenderly, with tears streaming
down his cheeks, Waso obeyed the instructions.
Drawing off the beautiful green
and yellow garments, he buried his
strange friend in the soft black soil.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Then he returned to his father&#8217;s home.
But every day he visited the lonely
grave far away at the edge of the forest.
Carefully he pulled away the weeds
and in the dry season he carried water
in gourds to keep the earth soft and
moist. Then one day, to his joy, he
saw that the green plumes of the
stranger&#8217;s head-dress were pushing through
the soil. His friend was coming back
to him.</p>

<p>All this time Waso had kept these
things a secret, but as the summer
drew to a close, he led his father to
the distant grave. He told the chieftain
the strange story, and, when he
had finished, pointed to where there
rose from the center of the stranger&#8217;s
grave a plant whose like had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
been seen before by the chieftain. As
tall as a man it stood, straight and green,
with broad shining leaves waving in the
autumn breeze, topped by silky bright
brown hair and nodding green plumes.
From either side grew long green husks
full of pearly white grains, sweet and
juicy to the taste.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image055.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE CARRIED WATER IN GOURDS</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;It is my friend come back to me,&#8221;
cried Waso. &#8220;It is Mandowmin, the Indian
corn. It is the gift of the Great
Spirit, and so long as we renew it from
year to year, and watch and tend it, we need
never fear the famine.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night, round the grave of Mandowmin,
the members of the tribe held
a feast and thanked the Great Spirit
for his goodness.</p>

<p class="ph2">Awahnee and the Giant</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">YEARS and years ago, when there were
no white men in all the great land
we now call North America and the
Indians were free to roam the woods,
living by the fish they speared and the
deer they shot, men knew very little
about the world in which they lived.
They did not understand why we have
day and night, sun and moon, summer
and winter, and so they made up all
sorts of pretty stories about these
strange facts.</p>

<p>When the last leaves of autumn had
fallen, and the Indians were glad to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
huddle around the fires in their wigwams,
little Indian boys and girls
would ask their elders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does it grow colder?&#8221; &#8220;Will it
ever be warm again?&#8221; and dozens of
other questions. And here is the tale
that the old men of one tribe always
told the little folks in answer.</p>

<p>Long ago, there lived a great hunter,
A-wah-nee, a tall young brave. No one
in all his tribe could shoot an arrow so
far or so straight as could A-wah-nee.
When he was still a very young man,
his fame had spread even beyond his
own land to other tribes.</p>

<p>He kept two great pet wolves as hunting
dogs, huge fierce animals that were
the terror of the tribe. And well they
might be, too, for they were under a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
spell. When A-wah-nee was deep in the
forest and saw a deer near him, he had
only to say &#8220;Up wolves&#8221; and in an instant
they were as big as bears and had
pounced upon the deer. Then he would
say &#8220;Down wolves&#8221; and once more they
would be their own proper size.</p>

<p>In a few years the deer in the forest,
on the edge of which A-wah-nee
and his grandmother lived in a small
wigwam, had grown so clever and wary
that they kept themselves hidden away
all the day and roamed only at night.
Presently A-wah-nee began to long for
other forests where the deer were not so
shy. At last one day he brought in
from the hunt a half dozen fine deer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dry that meat in the sun,&#8221; he said to
his grandmother, &#8220;and you will have food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
in plenty until I return. I am going
on a journey to other hunting grounds
where game is bigger and more plentiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he slung his snow shoes over his
shoulder, for it was nearing the cold
days, caught up his bow and arrows
and his hunting knife, and strode off
toward the north. As he journeyed he
saw many a fine deer and moose. Some
he shot, others he let go unharmed, for
he was always seeking bigger game.
Ever the wind grew more cold and
cutting, the grass and leaves began to
wither and disappear, and soon there
was a covering of ice on the water and
a blanket of snow on the ground.</p>

<p>But A-wah-nee put on his snow shoes
and went skimming away, until at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
he came to a huge wigwam almost
buried in the drifts of snow. There was
a thread of smoke curling up from the
top, and A-wah-nee, who had begun to
feel cold and weary, lifted the tent
flap and walked in.</p>

<p>There was but one person in the wigwam,
a very old giant, with deep
wrinkles in his face, and snow white hair
and beard. When he spoke, his great
voice sounded like the howling of the
north wind in the pine trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! young brave,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Who are
you? Whence come you? What do you
want in my wigwam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am A-wah-nee,&#8221; answered the young
man proudly; &#8220;mightiest hunter of my
tribe. I have killed all the game worthy
of my bow, and now seek new quarry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
bigger and fleeter. But tell me your
name, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winter!&#8221; roared the white haired giant
in such a fierce tone that A-wah-nee
began to feel afraid of him. &#8220;I rule
the Kingdom of Cold. I bring the snow
and ice. My breath kills all it touches.
But sit down if you are not afraid of
me. I bid you welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>A-wah-nee was ashamed to show his
fear after the boasting remark he had
made at first, so he sat down by the giant&#8217;s
fire, took a bit of moose meat from a
leather pouch at his side, and began to
eat it. While the old man related tales
of great hunts and battles of his
younger days and told of the wonderful
deeds the frost giants had wrought at his
bidding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>A-wah-nee was amazed at these stories,
which made him feel that perhaps, after
all, he was not as great a hunter as
he had believed. Presently, in spite of
the glowing fire beside him, the young
brave began to feel very chilly. His
teeth chattered and he tried to jump up
and run about to warm himself.</p>

<p>But he could not move. Something
seemed to hold him hand and foot; his
head fell forward and he rolled over
on the ground, fast asleep. The giant
laughed until he fairly shook the forest,
and the echoes went rolling along like
distant thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a good sleep, my boy, before
you hunt again,&#8221; he laughed, as
he strode out of the wigwam, chuckling.</p>

<p>He had spoken the truth indeed, for it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
was six months before the charm was
over and young A-wah-nee awoke. When
at last he stretched his limbs and
opened his eyes, the old man, who was
sitting beside him, burst into roars of
laughter, and told him of the joke he
had played.</p>

<p>A-wah-nee was furious, but he kept his
anger to himself. Courteously he thanked
the giant for his welcome and for the
interesting stories, and bade him good-bye;
but as he set out for the southland,
he was saying in his heart: &#8220;The day
will come when I will mock you, old
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>He traveled on for many weeks. Gradually
the snow melted away, grass and
flowers began to appear, and when he
reached the southland, thousands of birds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
were twittering and singing in the trees.</p>

<p>People were singing too, there in the
southland, singing and dancing around
their beloved Queen of Summer. At
first A-wah-nee laughed when he saw
her, for she was only a mite of a
creature scarcely as tall as A-wah-nee&#8217;s
foot, with long black hair waving about
her shoulders and dark eyes flashing fire.
But as he looked at her, an idea
leaped into his mind, and grew and grew
into a great plan to fool the giant
Winter.</p>

<p>Carefully the young brave carried out
his scheme. First he went deep into the
heart of the forest and killed a deer. Then
he skinned it carefully, and made its
hide into long thin strips which he
rolled into a tight ball.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Returning to the place where the men
of the southland were singing and dancing
about their little Queen of Summer,
A-wah-nee waited his time. In a moment
when they were not on guard, he
caught up the tiny figure, tucked her
out of sight in a fold of his blanket, and
went striding away into the forest. As
he fled he took care to unwind some ten
or more turns of the deer-skin string
ball, and let the loose ends dangle several
yards behind him.</p>

<p>A-wah-nee was very fleet of foot and,
too, he had taken the men of the south
so entirely unawares that before they had
planned how to rescue their stolen
Queen, the thief was already deep in
the forest and quite out of sight. But
presently they came upon the deer string<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and, winding it up as they went, began to
follow where it led.</p>

<p>In the meantime A-wah-nee had
traveled far and reached, at last, the
wigwam of the giant Winter. As before,
the old man welcomed him pleasantly and
bade him enter, for he meant to exert
his spell over the young hunter once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit by my fire and rest,&#8221; he roared in
his great voice. &#8220;You must be weary
after your long hunt. I will tell you
tales of the giants while you refresh your
tired limbs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah no!&#8221; laughed A-wah-nee. &#8220;This
time, oh giant, I will tell the tales to
you,&#8221; and he smiled knowingly and began
to speak.</p>

<p>As he talked, a strange thing happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to the giant. His head nodded, his voice
grew weak, he shook all over, and tears
began to run from his eyes, for little
by little A-wah-nee had been drawing
the folds of his blanket away from the
little Queen of Summer, and she had
been watching the old man with bright
black eyes. At last she stepped out
boldly on A-wah-nee&#8217;s knee, and smiled at
Winter. Under that smile he grew
weaker and weaker until at last he fell to
the floor of the wigwam, and melted
away until nothing was left of him but
a pool of water from which came a
hoarse, moaning cry.</p>

<p>A-wah-nee and the little Queen turned
away from him and stepped out doors.
A great change had come over the scene.
The snow had gone, the grass was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
fresh and green, the ice had melted
away, and the brooks were trying to
sing even louder than the happy birds.
Everything was as beautiful as the southland
itself, even more so, for there was a
cool, sweet fragrance in the air that had
come from the pure snow as it melted.</p>

<p>Soon A-wah-nee and the little Queen
found themselves surrounded by the men
of the southland, and they were rejoiced
to see their beloved ruler once
more, safe and unharmed. When A-wah-nee
told them why he had borrowed
their little Queen, they were quite
ready to forgive him.</p>

<p>Indeed, they found the northland so
beautiful they longed to make it their
home, but A-wah-nee warned them that
the Summer Queen&#8217;s power could last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
but six months. At the end of that
time the old giant Winter would rise from
the pool of water, resume his former
shape, and with his breath freeze all
the country, over which he ruled.</p>

<p>So from that time on, the men of the
southland came each year to the frozen
realm of the old giant Winter, bringing
their little Queen of Summer, and with
her approach the old man was forced to
take a six months&#8217; nap. And so it has
been even to this day. While the giant
sleeps, the world is bright and sunshiny;
the flowers and the birds sing; but
when he awakens, he freezes the rivers
and covers the earth with a blanket of
snow.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
